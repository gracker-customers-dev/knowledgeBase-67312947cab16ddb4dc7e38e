Decrypting the Signature\nUpon receiving the signed message, the recipient decrypts the signature using the signer's public key. This reveals the hash that was originally created.\n\n### 3. Comparing Hashes\nThe recipient then generates a new hash from the received message. If the newly generated hash matches the decrypted hash from the digital signature, the message is verified as authentic and untampered.",
